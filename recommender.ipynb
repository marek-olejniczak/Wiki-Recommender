    "This notebook walks through the complete process of building and using the article recommendation system. It uses the classes defined in the `components` directory to perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Scrape Wikipedia Articles**: Scrape articles from Wikipedia and save them as CSV files.\n",
    "2.  **Merge Articles**: Combine individual scraped article CSVs into a single corpus.\n",
    "3.  **Process Corpus**: Tokenize, stem, and lemmatize the text from the merged corpus.\n",
    "4.  **Process History**: Scrape and process a new list of URLs (simulating browsing history).\n",
    "5.  **Build/Load Model**: Create or load a TF-IDF model from the processed corpus.\n",
    "6.  **Get Recommendations**: Find and display the most relevant articles from the corpus based on the history.\n",
